# pump number -- i
pumpConsts <- list(N = 10,
t = c(94.3, 15.7, 62.9, 126, 5.24,
31.4, 1.05, 1.05, 2.1, 10.5))

#Â number of failures for pump -- x[i]
pumpData <- list(x = c(5, 1, 5, 14, 3, 19, 1, 1, 4, 22))

# failure rate -- theta
# Goal is to estimate the value of parameters alpha and beta
# which are used to specify the arrival time -- lambda
pumpCode <- nimbleCode(
  {
for (i in 1:N){
  theta[i] ~ dgamma(alpha,beta)
  lambda[i] <- theta[i]*t[i]
  x[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])
  }
alpha ~ dexp(1.0)
beta ~ dgamma(0.1,1.0)

theta = rep(0.1, pumpConsts$N))

# Create the model object using nimbleModel()
pump <- nimbleModel(code = pumpCode, name = "pump", constants = pumpConsts,
                    data = pumpData, inits = pumpInits)

# model$getNodeNames() lets us look at the nodes that comprise the model's
# directed acyclic graph (DAG), and model$plotGraph() lets us plot this DAG

# To look at individual nodes, use the syntax model$nodename
# e.g pump$x, pump$theta, pump$lambda

# Show all dependencies of alpha and beta terminating in stochastic nodes
# pump$getDependencies(c("alpha", "beta"))
# and only deterministic dependencies
# pump$getDependencies(c("alpha", "beta"), determOnly = TRUE)

# To get the log probabilities of the likelihood, pump$logProb_x
# and pump$getLogProb("x") for the sum

# Simulate new theta values
set.seed(1) # This makes the simulations here reproducible
pump$simulate("theta")
# pump$theta # shows the new theta values

# Now calculate the new values of the dependencies of theta
pump$calculate(pump$getDependencies(c("theta")))
# pump$lambda # shows the new lambda values
# pump$logProb_x # shows the new log probabilities of the likelihood

# ----- 2.3 Compiling the model -----
Cpump <- compileNimble(pump) # complies in C++
# Cpump$theta
# the compiled model needs to be used before any compilation of algorithms

# ----- 2.4 One-line invocation of MCMC -----
# default NIMBLE MCMC algorithm is used to generate posterior samples
